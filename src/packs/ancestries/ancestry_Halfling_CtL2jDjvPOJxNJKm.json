    "description": "<p>Halflings are small humanoids with large hairy feet and prominent rounded ears. On average, halflings are 3 to 4 feet in height, and their ears, nose, and feet are larger in proportion to the rest of their body. Members of this ancestry live for around 150 years, and a halfling’s appearance is likely to remain youthful even as they progress from adulthood into old age. Halflings are naturally attuned to the magnetic fields of the Mortal Realm, granting them a strong internal compass. They also possess acute senses of hearing and smell, and can often detect those who are familiar to them by the sound of their movements.</p><p></p><h4>ANCESTRY FEATURES</h4><p><em><strong>Luckbringer:</strong></em> At the start of each session, everyone in your party gains a Hope.</p><p><em><strong>Internal Compass:</strong></em> When you roll a 1 on your Hope Die, you can reroll it.</p>",
