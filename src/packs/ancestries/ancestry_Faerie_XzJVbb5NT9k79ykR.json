    "description": "<p>Faeries are winged humanoid creatures with insectile features. These characteristics cover a broad spectrum from humanoid to insectoid—some possess additional arms, compound eyes, lantern organs, chitinous exoskeletons, or stingers. Because of their close ties to the natural world, they also frequently possess attributes that allow them to blend in with various plants. The average height of a faerie ranges from about 2 feet to 5 feet, but some faeries grow up to 7 feet tall. All faeries possess membranous wings and they each go through a process of metamorphosis. The process and changes differ from faerie to faerie, but during this transformation each individual manifests the unique appearance they will carry throughout the rest of their approximately 50-year lifespan.</p><p></p><h4>ANCESTRY FEATURE</h4><p><em><strong>Luckbender:</strong></em> Once per session, after you or a willing ally within Close range makes an action roll, you can <strong>spend 3 Hope</strong> to reroll the Duality Dice.</p><p><em><strong>Wings:</strong></em> You can fly. While flying, you can <strong>mark a Stress</strong> after an adversary makes an attack against you to gain a +2 bonus to your Evasion against that attack.</p>",
