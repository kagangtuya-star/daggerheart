    "description": "<p>Being part of an orderborne community means you’re from a collective that focuses on discipline or faith, and you uphold a set of principles that reflect your experience there. Orderborne are frequently some of the most powerful among the surrounding communities. By aligning the members of their society around a common value or goal, such as a god, doctrine, ethos, or even a shared business or trade, the ruling bodies of these enclaves are able to mobilize larger populations with less effort. While orderborne communities take a variety of forms—some even profoundly pacifistic—perhaps the most feared are those that structure themselves around military prowess. In such a case, it’s not uncommon for orderborne to provide soldiers for hire to other cities or countries.</p><p class=\"green Body-Styles_Body\"><em>Orderborne are often ambitious, benevolent, pensive, prudent, sardonic, and stoic.</em></p><p></p><h4>COMMUNITY FEATURE</h4><p><em><strong>Dedicated:</strong></em> Record three sayings or values your upbringing instilled in you. Once per rest, when you describe how you’re embodying one of these principles through your current action, you can roll a <strong>d20</strong> as your Hope Die.</p>",
